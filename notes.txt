Remove the auction extension
switch to soft delete

email.js db.js redis.js should be uniform inside the server.js
check it image accepts PNG,JPG,JPEG,HEIC, & WEBP - add heic to the formats

add rate limiting sendEmail

map DB duplicate field errors into more meaningful messages in the errorhandler

fix undefined in logger (terminal) & also log.warn 

implement rotate dkim keys

centralize all rateLimiter

Add schema validation (JOI) to env.js
Add a script to send a test email and verify DKIM headers

pass state data first and replace with api fetched data

Create a central configuration module that handles environment variables. This avoids scattered process.env calls and ensures defaults or errors are handled consistently.

Create global async error wrapper (catchAsync) so you donâ€™t need try/catch blocks inside every controller

Expose a /health endpoint that includes Cloudinary status:

npm test
npm test:watch //development
npm test:coverage //production generate coverage report
npm test:debug //debugger
npx mocha test/integration/userController.test.js
npx mocha test/integration/authController.test.js
NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules --no-warnings' npx mocha test/integration/userController.test.js

load default image before real image

cleaner response. The response does include quite a bit of information. We can trim it down by being more selective in what we send back.
Consistent across endpoints
Lighter (less data transfer)
Focused on what the client needs
Easier to work with in the frontend

Redis scan or keys which is better?

config files serialize .. uinform   

the 3 loggers combine into one api/http/request(Logger). globalErrorHandler or AppError we have to app.use one at the server.js

Redis is not logging so admin routes dont work
